Code for different Competition websites.

All projects are Eclipse based using GCC compiler. MainHeader.h contains functions for different code bases and corresponding files contain the actual function definitions.

==TESTING==

For testing any code, call the function in Main.cpp of the corresponding project.
You can turn off any function in MainHeader.h to speed up compile time.
